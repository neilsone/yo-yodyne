In January, 2012 my father was diagnosed with Stage IV Lung Cancer. Nine months
later in October during a stay at the hospital, the doctors told him they could
no longer treat him because his disease had progressed too far. They told him
to return home and enter hospice care. Just a week prior he had been hanging
out with his friends at his favorite Starbucks. The setback wasn't unexpected,
but happened faster than we all anticipated.

When he returned home news of his transition to hospice care spread quickly.
Letters and cards from friends and family poured in. As his disease progressed
and he got weaker, he was no longer able to read the cards himself. He could
however hear and understand what people said to him. I handed out my Google
Voice phone number and invited people to leave their messages for him in the
form of voice mail. That day dozens of messages started arriving every day. We
played them for my dad so he was able to hear the messages from people in their
own voices. 

The content of the phone calls were beautiful and touching. The messages helped
my dad know that lots of people were thinking of him and reaching out to him.
On October 27 he passed away. As I was preparing for the memorial service, I
listened to the messages and came up with the idea of using them in the
memorial service. Since the voice mails were in Google Voice I downloaded them
and edited them together to serve as my eulogy to my father.

Thanks to everyone who called in and left a voice mail.
